		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>Last updated: May 13, 2021</p>

		<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application "Party Calculator", which was created by myself; Brandon Walsh ("Metasophiea")</p>


		<h2>1 - What information does this application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
		<p>The application does not use, transmit, store or collect any user information, aside from the generated "high-score" which is stored only locally and only used in the application's 'sidenav'.</p>

		<p></p>I reserve the right to implement Google Analytic for anonymous statistics collection in the future. Their privacy policy is found here: http://www.iubenda.com/blog/privacy-policy-google-analytics/. This however is not relevant at this time as no such implementation has been made as of the date stated above.</p>


		<h2>2 - Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the application</h2>
		<p>No. I do not share any information obtained by this application.</p>


		<h2>3 - Data Retention Policy / Managing Your Information</h2>
		<p>All user information collected (if any, see section 1 above) is stored locally. The user may delete the data at any time by clearing the application cache.</p>


		<h2>4 - Children</h2>
		<p>I do not use the application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. A parent or guardian may contact me at partyCalculator@metasophiea.com if they have any concerns (I do not retain any information as stated in section 3).</p>


		<h2>5 - Security</h2>
		<p>Not applicable - the application does not retain, process or maintain user information in the cloud.</p>


		<h2>6 - Changes</h2>
		<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. You will be notified of any changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
