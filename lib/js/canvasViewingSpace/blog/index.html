2016-08-11-a - To Hell With That Text Object
---------------------------------------------------------
- I tried, but I'm just to tired and uninterested to do
  it..if text is required, one can create it in an image
- Did a little menu adjustment to realign things

  Thus brings us to the end of the current development. I
hope you had as much fun as I did...text getting the better 
of me is a bummer, but it means I can move onto other things
now (which is more interesting to me) I'll probably return
to the graphics portion of this project again, taking the 
old lavendel parts (or at least their concepts). The next 
job is to get the main page together, then..who knows..

..I suppose I should make a nicer landing scene for it...

2016-08-10-a - More Editor
---------------------------------------------------------
- Finished off Script Editor to have 
  - better selection of different elements
  - Edit, Replace, Plop In and Remove functions
  - nicer presentation of all the data a script element
    can hold
- Presentation mode now also slides smoothly to the first
  location regardless of it's transition data
- Begining presentation also closes all menus
- Load/Save handles Automovement Script too

  In conclusion, all I have left is the text object and
  it's menu...maybe tomorrow..

2016-08-08-a - Automove Script Editor
---------------------------------------------------------
- There's now an option to open the Automove Script Editor
  on the main menu, here one currently can get the details
  of the current position and add it to the automove script
  (with only the basic movement details)
  One can also type the number of a script element an view
  it's details (without movement details)
- There's also a button to start the presentation, this 
  removes the mouse interface and sets up the keyboard
  - spacebar -> next frame
  - r -> previous frame (which now uses a nice way of using
                         n's movement details to get to n-1's
                         position)
  - q -> end presentation
- New automoveScript commands for working with the script

2016-08-05-a - Holidays and Dir Changes
---------------------------------------------------------
- I'm on vacation from work, and feel the need to give
  this whole thing a break for a little while..all that's
  left to do to get to v0.2 is add a text object, it's
  menu, a input menu/method for auto viewport movement
  scripting then a 'presentation' mode..
  ...it's actually more than I thought as I typed that..
  still, something to do in future, and I think I should
  get it done before summer is out. The most of the 
  presentation commands are done, it just needs a 
  presentation "mode"...
     Anyway, I've taken some time to rearrange the dir a
  little, to make navigation and storage a easier
  This blog offically replaces the previous blog (and I'm
  reclaiming the 'Lavendel' name for other projects)
     For those interested, here are the previous two blogs
- - <a href="https://metasophiea.com/lib/js/canvasViewingSpace/blog/index_0.0.html">v0.0</a>
- - <a href="https://metasophiea.com/lib/js/canvasViewingSpace/blog/index_0.1.html">v0.1</a>
