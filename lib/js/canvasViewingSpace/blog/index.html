2016-08-08-a - Automove Script Editor
---------------------------------------------------------
- There's now an option to open the Automove Script Editor
  on the main menu, here one currently can get the details
  of the current position and add it to the automove script
  (with only the basic movement details)
  One can also type the number of a script element an view
  it's details (without movement details)
- There's also a button to start the presentation, this 
  removes the mouse interface and sets up the keyboard
  - spacebar -> next frame
  - r -> previous frame (which now uses a nice way of using
                         n's movement details to get to n-1's
                         position)
  - q -> end presentation
- New automoveScript commands for working with the script

2016-08-05-a - Holidays and Dir Changes
---------------------------------------------------------
- I'm on vacation from work, and feel the need to give
  this whole thing a break for a little while..all that's
  left to do to get to v0.2 is add a text object, it's
  menu, a input menu/method for auto viewport movement
  scripting then a 'presentation' mode..
  ...it's actually more than I thought as I typed that..
  still, something to do in future, and I think I should
  get it done before summer is out. The most of the 
  presentation commands are done, it just needs a 
  presentation "mode"...
     Anyway, I've taken some time to rearrange the dir a
  little, to make navigation and storage a easier
  This blog offically replaces the previous blog (and I'm
  reclaiming the 'Lavendel' name for other projects)
     For those interested, here are the previous two blogs
- - <a href="http://metasophiea.com/lib/js/canvasViewingSpace/blog/index_0.0.html">v0.0</a>
- - <a href="http://metasophiea.com/lib/js/canvasViewingSpace/blog/index_0.1.html">v0.1</a>
