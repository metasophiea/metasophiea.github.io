2016-06-19-a - Little Touches
---------------------------------------------------------
- Rewrote image a little, reintegrated that
- Created little subfunction that detects what address is
  accessing it and adjusts it's include addresses 
  accordingly (just for development)

2016-06-18-b - Getting Back To Speed 0.4
---------------------------------------------------------
- Reintegrated Mouse_Interface for viewport movements with
  the mouse.
- Object selection reintegrated. Still just polys, but you
  can select them and drag them about
- Fixed automove script to allow multiple actions to be 
  inserted in one go

2016-06-18-a - Rocking on Over to 0.4
---------------------------------------------------------
There was a bug with the last version's autocontrol, when
it came to viewport rotation, so this version so far has
been very focused on getting that to work
- Starting from scratch, functions have new names, and
  things are more modular now
- Separated tasks out further, reducing number of times
  parts access globals
- Added new 'calculations.js' file for useful tasks that
  aren't specific to the project (like getting polar 
  coordinates from cartesian (and reverse) or creating
  numerical processions of certain curves)
- Redid panning, zooming and spinning controls, as well as
  the automove system to be more stable...seems good so far

2016-06-12-a - Moving and Shakin' to 0.3
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed up the dragging functionality to deal with spun
  viewports
- Created autoviewport control functions, currently with
  none, linear, sin and cosin movement patterns
- Autoviewport control can be scripted from the command
  line (menus to take over)
- Created 'todo.txt' with some future works
- Renamed some vars for more lower casing

2016-06-11-a - Swiftly to 0.2
---------------------------------------------------------
- Rewrote 'poly' to be a better fit towards how it's used
- Created shape creator - currently only makes rectangles
  of random colour
- Rewrote 'list' object to have private values, and 
  preform Z position movements
- You can drag objects, but not before you have selected
  them first with a click. Selecting a poly changes its
  colour temporarily. It also brings said poly forward

2016-06-10-a - The Quick Begining of 0.1
---------------------------------------------------------
Considering that I'm getting a little overwhelmed with
the Lavendel project, with it being developed with a very
general concept in mind; I've decided to switch my efforts
to what began this project and focus on making this single-
use tool. As such, generalisations can be removed, and 
development can move much quicker (which is necessary as
I need to have made a presentation by september)
After this is done, work can continue on Lavendel proper

- Shipped in most of Lavendel 0.7
- Spread out files in new layout, with a special folder
  just for js objects. System maintains the nice, single
  link nature of 0.7
