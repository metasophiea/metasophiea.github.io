2016-06-11- - Moving and Shakin' to 0.3
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed up the dragging functionality to deal with spun
  viewports
- Created autoviewport control functions, currently with
  none, linear, sin and cosin movement patterns
- Autoviewport control can be scripted from the command
  line (menus to take over)
- Created 'todo.txt' with some future works
- Renamed some vars for more lower casing

2016-06-11- - Swiftly to 0.2
---------------------------------------------------------
- Rewrote 'poly' to be a better fit towards what's used
- Created shape creator - currently only makes rectangles
  or random colour
- Rewrote 'list' object to have private values, and 
  preform Z position movements
- You can drag objects, but not before you have selected
  them first with a click. Selecting a poly changes its
  colour temporarily. It also brings said poly forward

2016-06-10- - The Quick Begining of 0.1
---------------------------------------------------------
Considering that I'm getting a little overwhelmed with
the Lavendel project, with it being developed with a very
general concept in mind; I've decided to switch my efforts
to what began this project and focus on making this single-
use tool. As such, generalisations can be removed, and 
development can move much quicker (which is necessary as
I need to have made a presentation by september)
After this is done, work can continue on Lavendel proper

- Shipped in most of Lavendel 0.7
- Spread out files in new layout, with a special folder
  just for js objects. System maintains the nice, single
  link nature of 0.7
