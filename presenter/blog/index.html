2016-07-11-a - 0.6 Looking Good
---------------------------------------------------------
- Rearranged files to better suit new drawing method
- Creating and developing "adjustableRectangle" object, 
  which has grabbers in the corners, sides and centre for
  changing the height, width and angle. (Should be simple
  to rewrite as an image

2016-07-03-a - SubShaping
---------------------------------------------------------
- This weekend brought about work on 0.5, which incliudes
  a new way of drawing objects
- Instead of having each object contain its drawing code,
  they instead send all their drawing data to a seperate 
  shape-drawing subfunction, thus keeping the line-count
  down
- I've seperated out some common shape functions, for the
  same reason 
- I also dabbled a little in subshaping (where one shape
  can contain many others) I've gotten a rough version
  together, that allows subselection (so I'm no longer
  limited by that 255^3 object limit) and the shapes within
  a shape, are positioned relitive to an origin point in
  the parent shape, allowing for a more natural method of
  positioning...this needs heavy work
- I also rearranged the files a little...that needs lots
  of work too
- I have an example 'adjustable_rectangleObject' where 
  pulling the topleft tab changes the height and width 
  (though not properly) and I'll need to rewrite most of 
  this for 0.6 to make it all tighter and allow better 
  shape control
  The other shape to the left, allows you to move the 
  inner sqare, without moving the outter one. While moving
  the outter one moves the inner. Moving the inner shape
  outside its parent brakes things a little however (the
  shape becomes unselectable)

2016-06-28-a - square.js
---------------------------------------------------------
- Had a go at writing a square object that has little tabs
  you can pull to adjust size.
- Wrote in a (rather slap-dash) 'mouseover'/'mouseout' 
  system..it needs work

2016-06-27-a - text.js
---------------------------------------------------------
- Had to do repairs on the image object's efficiency code
  it still can't cope with the idea of having an anchor
  outside the image...work needed
- Added in text.js, an improvement over the last veresion,
  this version uses a scaling method to change the size of
  the font during zoom, thus it is now smoother. There's 
  still some jitter...I'm not sure where that come's from.
  I'll be looking into that
- I also did a little clean up work, baised on some notes
  I put in the todo.txt

2016-06-19-a - Little Touches
---------------------------------------------------------
- Rewrote image a little, reintegrated that
- Created little subfunction that detects what address is
  accessing it and adjusts it's include addresses 
  accordingly (just for development)

2016-06-18-b - Getting Back To Speed 0.4
---------------------------------------------------------
- Reintegrated Mouse_Interface for viewport movements with
  the mouse.
- Object selection reintegrated. Still just polys, but you
  can select them and drag them about
- Fixed automove script to allow multiple actions to be 
  inserted in one go

2016-06-18-a - Rocking on Over to 0.4
---------------------------------------------------------
There was a bug with the last version's autocontrol, when
it came to viewport rotation, so this version so far has
been very focused on getting that to work
- Starting from scratch, functions have new names, and
  things are more modular now
- Separated tasks out further, reducing number of times
  parts access globals
- Added new 'calculations.js' file for useful tasks that
  aren't specific to the project (like getting polar 
  coordinates from cartesian (and reverse) or creating
  numerical processions of certain curves)
- Redid panning, zooming and spinning controls, as well as
  the automove system to be more stable...seems good so far

2016-06-12-a - Moving and Shakin' to 0.3
---------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed up the dragging functionality to deal with spun
  viewports
- Created autoviewport control functions, currently with
  none, linear, sin and cosin movement patterns
- Autoviewport control can be scripted from the command
  line (menus to take over)
- Created 'todo.txt' with some future works
- Renamed some vars for more lower casing

2016-06-11-a - Swiftly to 0.2
---------------------------------------------------------
- Rewrote 'poly' to be a better fit towards how it's used
- Created shape creator - currently only makes rectangles
  of random colour
- Rewrote 'list' object to have private values, and 
  preform Z position movements
- You can drag objects, but not before you have selected
  them first with a click. Selecting a poly changes its
  colour temporarily. It also brings said poly forward

2016-06-10-a - The Quick Begining of 0.1
---------------------------------------------------------
Considering that I'm getting a little overwhelmed with
the Lavendel project, with it being developed with a very
general concept in mind; I've decided to switch my efforts
to what began this project and focus on making this single-
use tool. As such, generalisations can be removed, and 
development can move much quicker (which is necessary as
I need to have made a presentation by september)
After this is done, work can continue on Lavendel proper

- Shipped in most of Lavendel 0.7
- Spread out files in new layout, with a special folder
  just for js objects. System maintains the nice, single
  link nature of 0.7
