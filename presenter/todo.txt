- Proper text size scaling "ctx.scale(s, s);"
- Proper text rendering efficiency

- update "getViewportDifference" doesn't need 'event'
- 'redCross' & 'greenCross' have no var
- "getColourFromId" grouping could have native method
- "moiseInterfaceEvent" doesn't need 'this'
- 'render' for loop could be replaced with a native js dot command
- 'Presenter.js' 'view' has no var
- 'document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(temp);' maybe just 'document.head.appendChild(temp);'?
- 'numberList.js' needs name work, and .find should be more efficient
- .addID not selecting for id's not placed at the end
- perhaps rename 'background' and 'main' ..background and foreground?
- 'poly's construct section for adding points should be simple assignment
- image.draw for loops on ifs
