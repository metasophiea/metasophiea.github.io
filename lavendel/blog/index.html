2016-06-05-a - The Sudden Beginning of Lavendel 0.7
---------------------------------------------------------
- Removed "./Lavendel" folder, as it turned out that it
  was never actually needed. Created 
  "./TestProjects/CanvasViewingSpace_4" as a catcher with
  a similar cause
- Created 'list' object for draw lists. This simplifies
  list interaction and working with the ID system
- Created mouse interface..its a little clunky but solid.
  It incorporates viewport controls and acesses object 
  methods for correct situations. Method list now;
  - Selected       (indicating that an object has been 
                   selected, but not necessarily clicked)
  - Unselected
  - Click
  - DoubleClick
  - Pass
  - Drag
  - Passout
  - Out
  - Wheel
- Snazzy rendering efficiency for images didn't work while
  zooming, have rewritten again. Still snazzy.
- Began renaming some of the global vars and functions to
  have assembly-esk prefixes

2016-05-29-a - Beginnings of Lavendel 0.6
---------------------------------------------------------
- Completed switch to new subdomain. Syncing with github
  on windows is a bit dodge due to the two 'lavendel' 
  folders. Case isn't important in windows it seems. 
- Combined 'globals' file into './lavendel.js' file, to 
  ease inclusion and reduce line count. Also arranged 
  some new variables in there, such as the link list
- Added new 'ClickAndDrag' function into objects 
  (should probably be named just 'drag')
- Rewrote 'mouse.js' a little to better facilitate the
  dragging function
- Rearranged and renamed files and functions to unify
  casing
- Rewrote 'image's Draw function to allow user defined
  anchoring. Also includes snazzy rendering efficiency
  which might come in handy for 'text'

2016-05-28-a - Created New Domain Structure For /Lavendel
---------------------------------------------------------
http://metasophiea.com/lavendel /0.5
				/0.6
				/blog
				/info

- Note lowercase 'L' in 'lavendel'
- Accessing './lavendel' redirects to './lavendel/info'
- Folders and pages are currently empty, awaiting switch
  from './Lavendel'.
- Also, welcome to the inaugural post of the Lavendel
  development blog. I'm liking this text style too.
